Find the error.
double getAverage(int arr[], int size);
int main () {
int balance[5] = {1000, 2, 3, 17, 50};
double avg;
avg = getAverage( balance[0], 5 ) ;
cout << "Average value is: " << avg << endl;
return 0;
}


Output :: The error in the code is in the way we are passing the array balance to the function getAverage(). We are passing balance[0] instead of balance. Here's the corrected version:

 avg = getAverage(balance, 5);
